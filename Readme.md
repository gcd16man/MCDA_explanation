Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and Explanation
One of the aims of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is to help the decision makers gain deep insights into a decision problem. We present an explanation system which aims to provide an explanation 'intervention' in order to provide guidance on exploring decision data in a Multi-Attribute Value Theory setting: (i) Relative weights that illustrate the extent to which a criterion contributes to the overall evaluation of alternatives, and (ii)Value function shapes over scores that we believe are instrumental in determining the output of an intervention.

In order to illustrate the 'dialogue' between the explanation system and the decision maker we use a location example that has been extensively discussed in Belton and Stewart (2002). A Natural Language Generation system has been developed based on simpleNLG.
